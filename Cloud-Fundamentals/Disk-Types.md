# Disks and Different Kinds of Disks

Disks are storage devices used to store data in computing environments, including cloud infrastructure. Cloud providers offer different types of disks optimized for performance, durability, and cost-efficiency.

## Types of Disks

### 1. **HDD (Hard Disk Drive)**
- Traditional spinning disk storage.
- **Pros:** Cost-effective for large storage needs.
- **Cons:** Slower performance compared to SSDs.
- **Use Cases:** Archival storage, infrequent access workloads.

### 2. **SSD (Solid State Drive)**
- Flash-based storage with faster read/write speeds.
- **Pros:** High performance, lower latency.
- **Cons:** More expensive than HDDs.
- **Use Cases:** Databases, high-traffic applications, boot disks.

### 3. **NVMe SSD (Non-Volatile Memory Express SSD)**
- Faster than traditional SSDs, leveraging PCIe interface.
- **Pros:** Ultra-low latency, high-speed performance.
- **Cons:** Expensive and overkill for low-performance needs.
- **Use Cases:** AI/ML workloads, big data processing, gaming applications.

## Cloud Provider Disk Offerings

| Cloud Provider | HDD | SSD | NVMe SSD |
|---------------|-----|-----|----------|
| **AWS** | Magnetic (Standard) | GP2, GP3 (General Purpose), IO1, IO2 (Provisioned IOPS) | Instance Store NVMe |
| **Azure** | Standard HDD | Standard SSD, Premium SSD | Ultra Disk (NVMe) |
| **GCP** | Standard Persistent Disk | SSD Persistent Disk | Local SSD (NVMe) |

## Key Performance Metrics
- **IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second)** – Higher in SSDs and NVMe.
- **Throughput** – Speed of data transfer, crucial for performance-sensitive applications.
- **Latency** – Lower latency results in faster response times.

## Best Practices
- Choose **HDD** for cold storage and cost-effective backup solutions.
- Use **SSD** for moderate-to-high performance workloads.
- Opt for **NVMe SSD** for high-performance computing and real-time processing.
- Implement **disk snapshots and backups** for data protection.
- Monitor disk usage and optimize for cost efficiency.
