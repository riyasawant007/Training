# VM Backups

VM backups are essential for ensuring data integrity, disaster recovery, and business continuity. Backups store a full or incremental copy of a virtual machine, allowing recovery in case of failure, corruption, or accidental deletion.

## Types of VM Backups

### 1. **Full Backup**
- Captures the entire VM, including OS, applications, and data.
- **Pros:** Complete recovery possible.
- **Cons:** Requires more storage space and longer backup times.

### 2. **Incremental Backup**
- Saves only the changes made since the last backup.
- **Pros:** Faster and more storage-efficient.
- **Cons:** Restoration may take longer as multiple backups must be combined.

### 3. **Differential Backup**
- Backs up changes since the last full backup.
- **Pros:** Faster than full backups, simpler restoration compared to incremental backups.
- **Cons:** Requires more storage than incremental backups.

## VM Backup Solutions by Cloud Providers

| Cloud Provider | VM Backup Service |
|---------------|------------------|
| **AWS** | AWS Backup (supports EC2, EBS, RDS, etc.) |
| **Azure** | Azure Backup (supports VMs, Disks, and SQL databases) |
| **GCP** | Backup and DR Service (for Compute Engine, Databases) |

## Best Practices for VM Backups
- **Automate backups** to ensure consistent and scheduled protection.
- **Encrypt backups** to protect sensitive data.
- **Store backups in multiple locations** to ensure redundancy.
- **Regularly test restoration** to verify backup integrity.
- **Implement retention policies** to manage storage costs effectively.

By following these best practices, organizations can ensure their virtual machines remain protected against failures, accidental deletions, and cyber threats.
