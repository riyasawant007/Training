# Cloud Storage Services

Cloud storage services provide scalable and reliable data storage solutions for various applications. These services allow users to store, retrieve, and manage data across distributed infrastructure.

## Types of Cloud Storage Services

### 1. **Object Storage**
- Stores unstructured data as objects.
- Suitable for images, videos, backups, and large datasets.
- Examples:
  - **AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service)**
  - **Azure Blob Storage**
  - **Google Cloud Storage**

### 2. **Block Storage**
- Provides storage at the block level, similar to traditional hard drives.
- Suitable for virtual machines, databases, and high-performance applications.
- Examples:
  - **AWS EBS (Elastic Block Store)**
  - **Azure Managed Disks**
  - **Google Persistent Disk**

### 3. **File Storage**
- Offers a shared file system accessible by multiple instances.
- Suitable for applications requiring file-based access.
- Examples:
  - **AWS EFS (Elastic File System)**
  - **Azure Files**
  - **Google Filestore**

## Storage Tiering and Cost Optimization
Cloud storage services offer different tiers based on access frequency and performance:
- **Hot Storage** – High-performance, frequently accessed data.
- **Cold Storage** – Low-cost, infrequently accessed data.
- **Archive Storage** – Cheapest option for long-term storage needs.

## Best Practices for Cloud Storage
- **Enable versioning** to protect against accidental deletions.
- **Use lifecycle policies** to automate data retention.
- **Encrypt data** at rest and in transit for security.
- **Optimize storage tiers** to reduce costs based on usage patterns.
